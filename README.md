# CORS proxy application in Node.js for Weather application (https://github.com/ShadowDrake21/weather-app)

This is an helper application for my Weather project that allows me to avoid CORS errors during the work with application.

## Versions
In the first version of the app, I'd used Node.js only with hosting on Render (https://render.com/). 
Now, in the version 2, I've decided to move to Firebase functions + Firebase Hosting combination in order to reduce execution time of request after inactivity time.
